Dilmaj Persian Dictionary version 0.5 - INSTALL
*********************************************

Dilmaj is a small and fast English-to-Persian dictionary for GNU/Linux console.

The idea is very simple. You type dilmaj [WORD] and the program returns the meaning in ASCII art form.

As many terminal emulators have still difficulties displaying right-to-left Persian text, this provides a quick, save and dirty way for looking words up in the command-line.
